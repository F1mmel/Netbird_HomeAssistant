## Overview

The **NetBird Add-on** allows you to securely connect your Home Assistant instance to your **NetBird** network using a lightweight WireGuard-based overlay.  
This makes your Home Assistant accessible through your existing NetBird setup, without exposing any ports to the internet.

NetBird automatically handles secure peer-to-peer connections and NAT traversal, making remote access simple and safe.

The add-on uses the following configuration options:

| Option               | Type | Description |
|----------------------|------|-------------|
| `endpoint`           | str  | NetBird management URL (e.g. `https://netbird.example.com`) |
| `token`              | str  | Setup key for adding this device to your NetBird network |
| `hostname`           | str  | Optional: Custom hostname for this device (default: HomeAssistant) |
| `nginx_port`         | int  | Port on which the internal Nginx web interface will listen |
| `homeassistant_ip`   | str  | IP address of the Home Assistant host (used for proxying requests) |
| `homeassistant_port` | int  | Port of Home Assistant (usually 8123) |

### Example Configuration

```yaml
endpoint: "https://netbird.example.com"
token: "YOUR_SETUP_KEY_HERE"
hostname: "HomeAssistant"
nginx_port: 8888
homeassistant_ip: "192.168.178.53"
homeassistant_port: 8123
```
### Access via NetBird

Once the add-on is connected to your NetBird network, you can access your Home Assistant instance securely via:

**http://NETBIRD_PEER_IP:nginx_port**

- `NETBIRD_PEER_IP` is the IP assigned to your Home Assistant device in the NetBird network.  
- `nginx_port` is the port you configured in the add-on options (`nginx_port`).  

For example, if your NetBird peer IP is `100.97.71.93` and `nginx_port` is `8888`, you can open:

**http://100.97.71.93:8888**

in your browser to reach Home Assistant through the NetBird network.
